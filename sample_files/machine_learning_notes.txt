Machine Learning Notes - Study Guide

1. Supervised Learning
   - Classification: Predicting a category (spam/not spam, cat/dog)
   - Regression: Predicting a continuous value (house price, temperature)
   - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Clustering: Grouping similar items (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
   - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
   - Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM

3. Deep Learning
   - CNNs for image recognition
   - RNNs and LSTMs for sequence data
   - Transformers for NLP (BERT, GPT, T5)
   - GANs for generative tasks

4. Key Concepts
   - Overfitting vs Underfitting
   - Bias-Variance Tradeoff
   - Cross-validation
   - Feature Engineering
   - Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization)

5. Popular Frameworks
   - PyTorch
   - TensorFlow/Keras
   - scikit-learn
   - Hugging Face Transformers
