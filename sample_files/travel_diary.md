# Travel Diary — Goa Trip 2025

## Day 1 — Arrival
We arrived at Dabolim Airport around noon. The weather was perfect — sunny with a light sea breeze.
Checked into our beachfront hotel in Baga. The view from the balcony was stunning — golden sand and turquoise water.

## Day 2 — Beach Day
Spent the entire day at Anjuna Beach. We swam, played beach volleyball, and watched a beautiful sunset.
Had fresh seafood at a shack — grilled prawns and fish curry were incredible.

## Day 3 — Old Goa
Visited the Basilica of Bom Jesus and Se Cathedral. The Portuguese architecture is breathtaking.
Explored the spice plantations and bought some local spices.

## Day 4 — Water Sports
Tried parasailing and jet skiing at Calangute Beach. The parasailing view was out of this world!
In the evening, we went to a night market for souvenirs.

## Day 5 — Departure
Left with unforgettable memories of waves, sunsets, and great food.
Can't wait to come back!
